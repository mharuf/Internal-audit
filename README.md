<h1>Completing an internal audit checklist</h1>
As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate programme I was tasked with conducting an internal audit for a fictional company, using sample information provided by the programme. This involved completing a checklist for certain security controls to identify whether or not such controls were in place at the company. Furthermore, I completed a checklist which assessed whether or not the company adhered to regulations. Following this, I suggested recommendations for improvements. This activity was very interesting as it gave me an insight into one of the important tasks that cybersecurity analysts participate in.
